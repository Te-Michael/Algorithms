## Work done in mt_branch1:

The `ArrayStack` class contains the `push` function [here](src/main/java/com/williamfiset/algorithms/datastructures/stack/ArrayStack.java). <br>
The `StackTest` class contains the test for push, called: `testPush` [here](src/test/java/com/williamfiset/algorithms/datastructures/stack/StackTest.java).
<br><br>
In the image below, weâ€™re checking coverage for testPush through the intellij coverage tester. <br><br>


We can see initially it's 2/3rds covered. as size == capacity is not covered (this can be seen with the red and green lines)
